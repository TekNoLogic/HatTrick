HatTrick is a small addon that adds checkboxes in the player paperdoll frame to toggle the helm and cloak settings.

Due to a nasty little bug in the default helm/clock config panel, HatTrick forcibly disables the default options' checkboxes and renders the global functions @ShowCloak@ and @ShowHelm@ inert.  I don't like being forced to do this, but it's the only option until they fix their little bug.
